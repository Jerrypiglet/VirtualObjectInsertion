# Virtual Object Insertion
This repository contains the code to generate the object insertion results in paper:
* Li, Z., Shafiei, M., Ramamoorthi, R., Sunkavalli, K., & Chandraker, M. (2020). Inverse rendering for complex indoor scenes: Shape, spatially-varying lighting and svbrdf from a single image. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 2475-2484).

The purpose for releasing the code is to 1) help researchers reproduce the photorealistic object insertion results included in our paper 2) facilitate the vision and graphics community to compare lighting estimation results. Please consider citing the paper if you find the code useful.
